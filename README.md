# 🌍 **Real-Time Global Event Monitoring with GDELT & Graph Analytics**

## 🚀 **Why We Participated**
Our participation in this hackathon was driven by our passion for innovation and our commitment to solving real-world challenges at the intersection of technology and finance.

Working in the financial sector, we understand the critical need for timely, actionable insights to drive effective decision-making. This application addresses several impactful use cases:

### 🔹 **Use Cases**
#### **Proactive Risk Management**
Early detection of global events such as geopolitical tensions, economic shifts, or emerging crises is vital for mitigating risk.
By leveraging GDELT’s real-time news monitoring, we can capture early signals of market volatility or systemic risks before they fully materialize.

#### **Investment Decision Support**
GDELT provides detailed sentiment analysis and an event taxonomy, allowing us to track global events and their perception.
This enables data-driven investment strategies, identifying emerging market opportunities or predicting downturns in specific regions.

#### **Innovative Use of Graph Analytics**
Using ArangoDB’s graph capabilities, we structure and analyze interconnected data from GDELT.
This reveals hidden patterns and relationships that are not immediately apparent through traditional data analysis.
Understanding complex connections between geopolitical events, market movements, and investor sentiment provides a competitive edge.

These real-world use cases demonstrate how Knowledge Graphs and LLMs can bring innovation to the financial world. We participated in this hackathon to showcase the practical value of combining open-source datasets with advanced analytics.

## 🛑 **Problem Statement**
Every day, global news outlets publish reports on conflicts, crises, and significant events. However, critical information is often lost due to the sheer volume of data.

For example:
- Early signs of social unrest or emerging health crises may go unnoticed.
- Manual monitoring is impossible due to the velocity and volume of global news.

## ✅ **Our Solution**
Our application automatically monitors and analyzes real-world events in real time, distilling actionable insights from worldwide news. The goal is to improve global situational awareness and support better decision-making.

## 📊 **Why We Chose GDELT**
We selected the GDELT dataset because it perfectly aligns with our application’s needs. Here’s why:

### 🌎 **1. Real-Time Global Coverage**
Monitors news media across every country in 100+ languages, updating every 15 minutes.
Ensures our application captures a truly global perspective beyond just English or Western sources.

### 📈 **2. Built-in Sentiment Analysis**
Captures the sentiment of news reports, helping assess public perception in real time.
Example: If protests are reported with a negative tone, it may indicate rising tensions.
Our tool analyzes sentiment trends to predict potential crises or market movements.

### 🏷️ **3. Comprehensive Event Taxonomy**
Classifies events into 300+ categories, from diplomatic meetings to violent conflicts.
This allows us to distinguish event types and track trends (e.g., surge in protests in a region).

### 🌍 **4. Geopolitical Context & Mapping**
Events are tied to locations and actors (countries, organizations, individuals).
Enables deep geopolitical analysis, mapping events, and filtering insights by region or actor.
Example: We can highlight unrest hotspots or trace the spread of a crisis across borders.

### 🔗 **5. Network/Graph Data for Hidden Insights**
GDELT structures events into a massive interconnected graph, linking people, organizations, locations, and events.
Using graph analytics, we:
- Identify influential entities driving key events.
- Detect clusters of related incidents based on shared participants or locations.
- Uncover hidden connections between news reports to reveal the bigger picture.

By leveraging GDELT’s open and scalable dataset, we focused on innovative analysis and visualization instead of spending time collecting data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
GDELT Dataset – Real-time global event tracking
LangSmith – For Tracibility of the LLM
Mem0 - Adding memory component of the conversation.
LangGraph - Agentic orchestration framework.

## 📢 **Conclusion**
This project showcases the power of open-source datasets, graph analytics, and AI-driven insights to transform decision-making in high-stakes environments like finance and geopolitics.

We believe that real-time global event monitoring will play a pivotal role in the future of risk management, investment strategies, and situational awareness. 🚀
